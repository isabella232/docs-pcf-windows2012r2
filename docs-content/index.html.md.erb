<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This documentation describes how operators install and manage Windows [cells](../concepts/architecture/index.html#diego-cell) in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) with PCF Runtime for Windows, and how developers push .NET apps to Windows cells.

Operators can install PCF Runtime for Windows on vSphere, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Operators who want to run Windows cells in PCF in order to enable developers to push .NET apps can deploy the PCF Runtime for Windows tile.

Deploying this tile creates a separate BOSH deployment populated with the Garden Windows release, which runs on a Windows cell built from a Windows stemcell.

Once the Windows cell is running, developers can specify a Windows stack when pushing .NET apps from the command line. PCF passes the app to the Windows cell in the Garden Windows BOSH deployment. The diagram below illustrates the process.

## <a id='rotate'></a>Rotating Credentials

The Elastic Runtime tile handles all of the credentials for PCF Runtime for Windows.

To rotate your credentials in PCF Runtime for Windows, re-deploy Elastic Runtime and PCF Runtime for Windows by navigating to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and clicking **Apply Changes**.
