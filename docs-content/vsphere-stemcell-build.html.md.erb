<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In vSphere, customers must build their own stemcells to use PAS for Windows 2012R2 in their on-premise deployments.

Create a stemcell by following the directions in [Creating a vSphere Windows Stemcell](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-windows-stemcell-builder/wiki/Creating-a-vSphere-Windows-Stemcell).

The process includes starting with an ISO of Windows Server 2012R2 and installing the latest Windows Updates on a new virtual machine. Then you install the BOSH dependencies. Finally, you use the `stembuild` tool to package the VM's disk as a `.tgz` file that can be [uploaded to the PAS for Windows 2012R2 tile](./installing-windows.html) in Ops Manager.
