This topic discusses the Azure Light Stemcell. "Light" stemcells are metadata files used on a public IaaS that enable users to reference and deploy a stemcell without uploading it manually. The actual stemcell lives on the cloud storage service of the IaaS and the BOSH Director instantiates the VMs.
